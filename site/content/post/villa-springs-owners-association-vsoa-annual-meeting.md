New Business:

Covenant Compliance:

A lot of improvements of the properties from the letters Gary had sent out.

Burn Pile:

Burn pile is a mess from last years storm still. Lots of rootballs there that will not burn. A letter will be sent out with the burn pile rules and regulations. Possibly close the burn pile in January and February to allow it to be pushed up/cleaned up and start from scratch in the spring. Was proposed to start a burn pile committee.

Road Maintenance/Funding Discussion:

\-Review the bylaws on roads, update to include standards that need to be met today.

\-We need a 10-year plan, which would include Lakeview Drive.

\-We got a bit from Asphalt Maintenance for doing an overlay of the entire lake for $320,000 without doing the sewer system.

\-Looking to get a couple more bids.

\-Proposal to increase dues of $500 per year per lot for a road maintenance fund. So dues would increase from $325 to $825 per year. Dues would be raised until a motion is made to decrease when we have enough of a balance in the Road Maintenance fund.

\-Money would be set aside so funds were available when needed.

\-Lakeview would be redone in 2019, would rebid then.

\-Vote was 30-Yes, 17-No. Motion passed.

\-New budget Adopted for 2019 to include the dues increase.
