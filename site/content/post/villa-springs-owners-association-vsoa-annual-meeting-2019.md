Committee Reports

Fish-Aaron Klusmire

Lake was healthy this year. We do have to have some weeds as they balance out the

bad algae. We will put in more grass carp this spring, they keep weeds down. Will add

walleye soon, this fall.

Aaron does a couple of weed sprays every spring and summer. It is up to the

homeowner to treat their areas if they feel it’s necessary. Please use products that are

labeled for lake water.

Aaron will get a map added to the website that shows where the fish habitats are

located.

Architectural- Gary Partusch for Alan Hans

Please submit plans to Alan before you start a project.

New Business:

Boat stickers:

Everyone needs to have these attached to their boats

Sanitation Sewer lines: Just an FYI that there are plans for these going in off of Buffalo

road sometime in the near future.

Trees: Homeowners need to make sure their trees are trimmed off the roads. Please

make sure branches are trimmed up so that they are not hitting trucks coming through.

Road Maintenance fund: This continues to build, $500 of annual dues goes towards

this fund. Once we get a sufficient amount we will start getting bids for future road work.

This will take some years to build up enough for that

Any spots that are in immediate need of repair, the board will look into a temporary fix

that would not include redoing the entire road itself.

Covenant compliance: homeowners are to keep their properties looking neat and

cleaned up. This includes lakeside and roadside. Gary will speak with individuals

separately who need to clean up their properties.

Rules and Regulations and Bylaws: The board has discussed changes being made to

the bylaws and realizes that some updates need to be made. A task force will be made

to discuss what we would like changed and bring to the board for discussion. We would

then need to have a special meeting to vote on these changes. Changing the bylaws

requires 51% attendance to vote on this, and cannot include proxies.

Items mentioned for change include; boating speed limit overall, speed limit in

channels, boats with skiers and tubers keeping so far away from shores and docks,

times set for skiing and tubing.

The Rules and Regulations taskforce will meet to form their proposal to the board, with

a meeting held by May 1, 2022.

A bylaws taskforce will meet to form their proposal to the board, with those changes

being voted on at the next annual meeting.

Air BNB: There is one being advertised on the lake. Gary will check with legal to make

sure this is ok and not going against our community rules.
