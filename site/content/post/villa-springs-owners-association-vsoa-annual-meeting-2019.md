Treasurer’s report attached.

Architectural- Alan Hans

Please submit plans to Alan before you start a project.

Rodney Brase wants to place a dock, which has been denied by the architectural

committee and the board as it is not in the lakes best interest and safe to work where

they want to place it. Rodney Brase is suing the lake for being denied. Architectural

committee has given options that would work where the homeowner wants to place the

dock. Mr Brase has rejected the alternate options offered by the Architectural

Committee.

Committee Reports

Fish/Lake-Aaron Klusmire

Lake was and is very low this year. Aaron only had to treat once this summer for

weeds/algae. Water clarity is good in some areas, worse in others, but overall was a

good summer for the lake as far as weeds and algae go. Fish are growing, which is

good. Aaron added Walleye a week prior to the meeting.

Aaron will add to the Lake website approved chemicals that can be used by

homeowners to treat their areas to manage lake weeds.

Reminder that when Aaron treats the lake, it has to be a calm, sunny day, so he can’t

always plan that much in advance. He will always notify homeowners before treating,

especially those who draw water from the Lake for lawn irrigation.

New Business:

Burn Pile:

Burn pile is now closed and will be until the county starts giving burn permits again.

Please do not add to the pile.

Road Maintenance Fund Next Steps:

Dues will stay the same until roads are complete. We are working towards the goal of

resurfacing the entire lakes roads. So dues would be increased for 5+ years so that we

have built up enough to cover the cost of the entire lake.

Considering doing a portion of a road since we are doing in stages. Could do North

Shore Dr. and Sandy Point Road using current funds available at the 3rd quarter of

2023.

Kelly K. son has given him pricing so we have some idea as to what cost will be. We

will need to get 2-3 more bids. His pricing right now is from $2.15/sft, but that depends

on how much we do at once. Right now asphalt is $100/ton. All that depends on the

time we actually move on getting something booked to be completed.

Bryan P made motion to spend up to $200,000 on North Shore and Sandy Point in the

3rd quarter of 2023, which would be after dues are collected next year. Motion passed.
